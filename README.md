Launchless

Ship your project without becoming a marketer.

Launchless helps builders turn unfinished ideas, GitHub repos, or deployed projects into ready-to-post launch content — without learning marketing, copywriting, or video editing.

No dashboards.
No analytics.
No growth hacks.

Just ship.

Why Launchless exists

Most builders don’t hate building.

They hate launching.

Writing posts feels fake

Marketing takes more time than coding

Video creation feels impossible

Editing tools are overwhelming

You end up shipping… nothing

Launchless removes the execution friction.

What Launchless does

You give Launchless one of these:

A GitHub repo

A website URL

A short project description

Click Generate Launch.

You instantly get:

A clear product positioning (1-liner)

The core hook (why this exists)

Platform-ready launch posts

Step-by-step video scripts (no editing required)

Follow-up content for the next 7 days

Simple call-to-action copy

No accounts.
No setup.
No learning curve.

The real value (important)

Launchless is not a “content generator”.

It’s a decision remover.

You don’t ask:

“What should I say?”

“How should I edit?”

“What platform should I use?”

“Is this good enough?”

You just follow steps.

No-Editing Video Mode (core feature)

Most builders don’t know how to make videos.

Launchless assumes:

Zero editing skills

Phone or laptop camera

No fancy tools

Example output:

Video plan (45 seconds total)

Open camera (10s)
Say what problem annoyed you.

Screen record (20s)
Show the repo / website / feature.

Back to camera (15s)
Say who this is for and why it exists.

Post it as-is.

No cuts.
No effects.
No perfection.

Supported platforms (MVP)

X (Twitter)

LinkedIn

Product Hunt

YouTube Shorts (scripts)

Instagram Reels (scripts)

More coming — only if builders actually need them.
